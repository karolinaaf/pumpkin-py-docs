# Functionalities

## autothread
This functionality creates automatic threads on every new message in a channel. Can be helpful in channels dedicated to questions.
When entering the command the bot should provide you with additional command options (depends on ACL):  
> __**autothread**__  
> \- **autothread list**  
> \- **autothread set**  
> \- **autothread unset**

### autothread list
Usage: `autothread list`  
Lists current autothread settings for channels of the guild.

### autothread set
Usage: `autothread set <channel> <duration>`  
Argument `channel` accepts tag of a channel or its ID. Argument `duration` sets the lifespan of the autogenerated threads. Value of this argument must be on of these values: `'1h', '1d', '3d', '7d'`.

### autothread unset
Usage: `autothread unset [channel]`  
After using this command, autothreads will not be generated in the provided channel. Argument `channel` defaults to the channel where this command is called.

## bookmarks
Bookmarks allow users to save a message for later. When bookmarks are active and member adds reaction "ğŸ”–" (:bookmark:) to a message, the bot will send this user a direct message containing the original message's text and link to that message.
When entering the command the bot should provide you with additional command options (depends on ACL):  
> __**bookmarks**__  
> \- **bookmarks list**  
> \- **bookmarks set**  
> \- **bookmarks unset**

### bookmarks list
Usage: `bookmark set`  
Lists current bookmarks settings of this guild.

### bookmarks set
Usage: `bookmarks set <enabled> [channel]`  
Sets the functionality to on (when the argument `enabled` is `True`) or off (`enabled` is `False`). Argument `channel` defaults to guild default.

### bookmark unset
Usage: `bookmarks unset [channel]`  
Removes bookmarks settings, which turns them off. Argument `channel` defaults to the whole guild.

## userpin
This functionality allows users to pin a message if enough members agree to pin it. Vote to pin the message is realized by reacting to a message with the emoji "ğŸ“Œ" (:pushpin:).
When entering the command the bot should provide you with additional command options (depends on ACL):  
> __**userpin**__  
> \- **userpin list**
