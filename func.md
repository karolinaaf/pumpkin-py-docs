# Functionalities

## autothread
This functionality creates automatic threads on every new message in a channel. Can be helpful in channels dedicated to questions. <br>
When entering the command the bot should provide you with additional command options (depends on ACL): <br>
> __**autothread**__ <br>
> \- **autothread list** <br>
> \- **autothread set** <br>
> \- **autothread unset**

Argument `channel` accepts tag of a channel or its ID. Argument `duration` sets the lifespan of the autogenerated threads. Value of this argument must be on of these values: `'1h', '1d', '3d', '7d'`.

### autothread unset
Usage: `autothread unset [channel]` <br>
After using this command, autothreads will not be generated in the provided channel. Argument `channel` defaults to the channel where this command is called.
